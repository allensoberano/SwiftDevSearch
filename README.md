# Swift Job Search

App to demonstrate swift skills.

# Demo

# Reason
Up to this point everything I have created in swift are in
private repositories, either through employment or released products.
Created this demo to demonstrate my swift skills and abilities for 
future employment.

# Notes
In order to run the app you will need the file with the API Keys or you can use your own.
If you would like to build and run the app, contact me and I will send you the secrets file if necessary.

UI: To save time I made the main view buttons random colors that change whenever the project is run.
